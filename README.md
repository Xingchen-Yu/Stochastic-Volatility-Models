# Stochastic-Volatility-Models



###### R Code to accompany the Sept 2020 and final version of

###  _A Note on Efficient Fitting of Stochastic Volatility Models_

#### The latest version is here: [paper](https://github.com/nickpoison/Stochastic-Volatility-Models/blob/master/paper.pdf) or here: [DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.29024.71687](10.13140/RG.2.2.29024.71687)


* The data are in the folder *data* and are compressed R data files.
* The various PGAS files are in the folder *R* ... these are sourced in the files used to run the examples.
* Each example is identified by starting with `run_` and then a self describing title.  You just run the code, it will call the data file and PGAS procedure as needed.
* Added an example from stochvol R package, but the essential part
of the code is in one of the vignettes.

 _You'll need the following R packages to run all the code:_

* astsa
* plyr
* MASS 
* mcmc
