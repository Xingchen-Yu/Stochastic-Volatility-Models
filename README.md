# Stochastic-Volatility-Models



##### R Code to accompany 

####  _A Note on Efficient Fitting of Stochastic Volatility Models_

**The preprint is available:** [here](paper_v2.pdf) and eventually at [arXiv](xxxx) 


* The data are in the folder *data* and are compressed R data files.
* The various PGAS files are in the folder *R* ... these are sourced in the files used to run the examples.
* Each example is identified by starting with `run_` and then a self describing title.  You just run the code, it will call the data file and PGAS procedure as needed.



 _You'll need the following R packages to run all the code:_

* astsa
* plyr
* MASS 
* mcmc

For the bibTeX item to the code here, I used the following:
<pre>
@misc{GitGongStoffer2019,
  author = {Gong, Chen and Stoffer, David S.},
  title = {{Stochastic Volatility Models}},
  howpublished = "\url{https://github.com/nickpoison/Stochastic-Volatility-Models/}",
  year = {2019}, 
  note = "[GitHub Repository]"
}  
</pre>
