# Stochastic-Volatility-Models



###### R Code to accompany the May 2020 version of

###  _A Note on Efficient Fitting of Stochastic Volatility Model_

**The preprint is available here and at ResearchGate: [paper.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/341753430_A_Note_on_Efficient_Fitting_of_Stochastic_Volatility_Models)**


* The data are in the folder *data* and are compressed R data files.
* The various PGAS files are in the folder *R* ... these are sourced in the files used to run the examples.
* Each example is identified by starting with `run_` and then a self describing title.  You just run the code, it will call the data file and PGAS procedure as needed.



 _You'll need the following R packages to run all the code:_

* astsa
* plyr
* MASS 
* mcmc
